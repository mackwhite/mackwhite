### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mack White!

### **Background**

I am a PhD Student at Florida International University (FIU) working with Dr. Jennifer Rehage and Dr. Rolando Santos in the [Coastal Fish Ecology and Fisheries Research Lab](https://myweb.fiu.edu/rehagej/) :fish: :palm_tree: :sunny: :tropical_fish:

### **Research Interests**

I am an ecosystem ecologist (*or at least that's what they tell me*) interested in the cycling of nutrients and flow of energy through the lens of animals. Specifically, my research aims to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms which drive patterns in consumer nutrient dynamics, food webs, and animal movement to provide a more holistic understanding of ecosystem function. 

I am also interested in data science. Though I have no formal training in the subject, I enjoy - *at least most of the time* - developing reproducible workflows, creating aesthetically-pleasing data visualizations, and striving to maintain [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data.

Though I do not have a personal website at the moment, feel free to check out the [website](https://mackwhite.github.io/cndwg_website/) I am developing (*in progress*) for our synthesis team looking at the consumer nutrient dynamics of marine ecosystems under the wake of global change.
