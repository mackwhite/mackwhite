### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mack White!

### **Background**

I am a PhD Candidate at Florida International University (FIU) working with Dr. Jennifer Rehage in the [Coastal Fish Ecology and Fisheries Research Lab](https://myweb.fiu.edu/rehagej/) :fish: :palm_tree: :sunny: :tropical_fish:

### **Research Interests**

I am an ecologist interested in the drivers of ecosystems across various scales (from elements to ecosystems). My research currently revolves around further understanding the contextual roles of animals in the cycling of nutrients and flow of energy within and across ecosystems. By combining field, experimental, and modeling techniques, I aim to bridge theories across different ecological disciplines to provide novel insights. The goal of my research is to provide a more holistic understanding of the natural world that informs conservation and management efforts.

I am also interested in data science. Though I have no formal training in the subject, I enjoy developing reproducible workflows, creating aesthetically-pleasing data visualizations, and striving to maintain [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data.
