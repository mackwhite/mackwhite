### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mack White!

### **Background**

I am a PhD Candidate at Florida International University (FIU) working with Dr. Jennifer Rehage in the [Coastal Fish Ecology and Fisheries Research Lab](https://myweb.fiu.edu/rehagej/) :fish: :palm_tree: :sunny: :tropical_fish:

### **Research Interests**

I am an ecologist that spends most of their time thinking about animal behavior (drivers and function). However, I truly enjoy thinking about any interesting ecological question. My research asks questions across levels of ecological organization â€“ from individuals to ecosystems â€“ in hopes of providing a more holistic understanding of the natural world that informs management, as well as theory.

I am also interested in data science. Though I have no formal training in the subject, I enjoy developing reproducible workflows, creating aesthetically-pleasing data visualizations, and striving to maintain [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data.
